Randomized-Guessing-Game
========================

Number guessing game using RNG to have a new answer every time (between 0 and 10)

User inputs a guess and the game answers with right/wrong. Number stays fixed for each new run of the game and does not change between guesses. User has unlimited guesses and can guess until the correct number is found

Possible changes:
*Limit amount of user guesses before game ends to restric users from just going through all possible numbers in sequence
*Add condition to immidiatly exit the program (rage quit)
